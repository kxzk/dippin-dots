Your job is to review the code as if you were a Staff Engineer.

1. Any bugs?
2. Any performance issues?
3. Any suboptimal designs?

YOU MUST DEEPLY understand the code before responding: READ, READ, READ (use subagents).

Respond in an extremely detailed fashion with examples.
Also, include filename + line number for any referenced code.

We want rock-solid AND elegant code.
